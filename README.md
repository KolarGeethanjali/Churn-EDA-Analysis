# Churn EDA Analysis â€“ Python Project

This project explores customer churn data using Python to uncover patterns and insights. It was done as part of learning Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) after completing Power BI training.

## Key Work Done
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Univariate & bivariate analysis
- Visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Correlation heatmap and insights on churn factors

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Files
- `churn_analysis.ipynb`: Main EDA notebook
-  `churn.csv`: Sample dataset used

## Status
Completed as a self-learning project to build EDA skills after Power BI.
